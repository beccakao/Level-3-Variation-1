		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<p>
		A free bird leaps on the back <br> Of the wind and floats downstream <br> Till the current ends and dips his wing <br> In the orange suns rays <br> And dares to claim the sky.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nsbp But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage <br> &nsbp Can seldom see through his bars of rage <br> &nsbp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br> &nsbp So he opens his throat to sing.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nsbp &nsbp The caged bird sings with a fearful trill <br> &nsbp &nsbp Of things unknown but longed for still <br> &nsbp &nsbp And his tune is heard on the distant hill for <br> &nsbp &nsbp The caged bird sings of freedom.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nsbp &nsbp &nsbp The free bird thinks of another breeze <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp And the trade winds soft through <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp The sighing trees <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp Lawn and he names the sky his own.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp So he opens his throat to sing.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp The caged bird sings with <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp A fearful trill of things unknown <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp But longed for still and his <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp Tune is heard on the distant hill <br> &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp &nsbp For the caged bird sings of freedom.
